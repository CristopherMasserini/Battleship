# Battleship
A project that can play a fully functional game of battleship. 

The GUI is done using tkinter and the testing with unittest. The project is done as a project to build experience and knowledge in python development. 

The project is laid out so that the game file is the only one dependent on the other two files, with the obvious exception of the test file. 

Done with Python 3.8.1
